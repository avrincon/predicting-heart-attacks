# predicting-heart-attacks

This repository is part of my *R Data Analysis* project for NYC Data Science Academy. 

The goal of this project was to:

1. Fit a logistic regression model to predict the risk of heart attack based on patient data.

2. Create a Shiny application to allow users to input patient data and receive a prediction of heart attack risk.

The Shiny application can be found [here]( https://avrincon.shinyapps.io/predictingHeartAttacks/).

The model was fitted on the [Heart Attack Risk Assessment Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fajobgiua/heart-attack-risk-assessment-dataset/data) from Kaggle.
